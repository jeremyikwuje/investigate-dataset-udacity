# Investigate a Dataset
### By Jeremy Ikwuje 

This is my first data analytics project while undergoing a nanodegree program on Udacity. Udacity, Inc. is an American for-profit educational organization founded by Sebastian Thrun, David Stavens, and Mike Sokolsky offering massive open online courses.

## Introduction
This case study investigated a dataset containing about 5000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). This dataset was doownloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv).

In this report I wish to identify the relationship between multiple variables in the dataset. Here are the question I plan on exploring:

> **Question 1:** Do movie genres with high budget generate high revenue?

> **Question 2:** Between high budget,  popularity, and high vote_count which is most likely to generate high revenue?

PS: Kindly note that the original data from IMDB has been taken down and replaced with a similar data from TMDB.
